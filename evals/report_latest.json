      "ground_truth": "From a free hit awarded to the attack within the 23-meter area, the ball must not be played into the circle until it has travelled at least 5 metres, not necessarily in a single direction, or has been touched by a player of the defending team. If the player taking the free hit continues to play the ball (ie no defending player has yet touched it): that player may play the ball any number of times, but the ball must travel at least 5 metres, before that player plays the ball into the circle by hitting or pushing the ball again.",
      "bot_answer": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the rules regarding free hits awarded to the attack within the 23-meter area, based on the provided context:\n\n**General Rule for Playing the Ball into the Circle:**\n\n*   **The ball must not be played into the circle until it has traveled at least 5 meters, or has been touched by a player of the defending team.** (Rule 13.2 f)\n\n**Exceptions:**\n\n*   **Free Hit Taken Immediately within 5 meters of the Circle:** If the free hit is awarded within 5 meters of the circle, the ball cannot be played into the circle until it has traveled at least 5 meters or has been touched by a defending player. (Rule 13.2 f)\n    *   **Defenders Shadowing:** Defenders who are inside the circle within 5 meters of the free hit may shadow around the inside of the circle a player who takes a self-pass, provided that they do not play or attempt to play the ball or influence play until it has either traveled at least 5 meters or alternatively been touched by a defending player who can legitimately play the ball. (Rule 13.2 f)\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n*   **Distance for Opponents:** Opponents must be at least 5 meters from the ball when a free hit is taken. If an opponent is within 5 meters, they must not interfere with the taking of the free hit or must not play or attempt to play the ball. (Rule 13.2)\n*   **Raising the Ball:** The ball may be raised immediately using a push, flick, or scoop but must not be raised intentionally using a hit. (Rule 13.2 e)\n*   **Self-Pass:** The player taking the free hit can play the ball any number of times, but the ball must travel at least 5 meters before that player plays the ball into the circle by hitting or pushing the ball again. (Rule 13.2 f)\n*   **After a Defending Touch:** After a defending player has touched the ball, it can be played into the circle by any other player, including the player who took the free hit. (Rule 13.2 f)\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nWhen a free hit is awarded to the attack within the 23-meter area, the primary restriction is that the ball cannot be played into the circle until it has traveled 5 meters or has been touched by a defender. The exception is when the free hit is awarded within 5 meters of the circle, where the same rule applies.\n",
