The penalty for dangerous play is awarded at the location where the dangerous action occurred.\n\n*   Players must not play the ball dangerously or in a way that leads to dangerous play. (rule 9.7)\n*   A ball is considered dangerous if it is dangerous in itself or causes legitimate evasive action by players. (rule 9.7)\n*   The penalty for dangerous play is awarded where the action causing the danger took place. (rule 9.7)\n*   Players must not intentionally raise the ball from a hit, except for a shot at goal, and then only when it is safe to do so. (rule 9.8)\n*   It is not an offense to raise the ball unintentionally from a hit, including a free hit, anywhere on the court unless it is dangerous. (rule 9.8)\n*   Raising the ball over an opponent's stick or body on the ground is permitted unless judged to be dangerous. (rule 9.8)\n*   Players are permitted to raise the ball with a flick or scoop provided it is not dangerous. (rule 9.8)\n*   A flick or scoop towards an opponent within 4 meters is considered dangerous. (rule 9.8)\n*   If an opponent is clearly running into the shot or into the attacker without attempting to play the ball with their stick, they should be penalized for dangerous play. (rule 9.8)\n*   Players must not play the ball dangerously or in a way which leads to dangerous play. (rule 9.7)\n*   Players must not touch, handle or interfere with other players or their sticks or clothing. (rule 9.3)\n*   Players must not lift their stick over the heads of other players. (rule 9.2)\n*   Umpires will penalise any action which is outside the spirit of the sport. (rule 9.14)\n*   A player who runs in front of or blocks an opponent to stop them legitimately playing or attempting to play the ball is obstructing. (rule 9.11)\n*   For any intentional offense by the defending goalkeeper against the player taking the challenge, a penalty stroke is awarded. (rule 13.4 d)\n*   If the shot at goal is a hit taken from between the halfway line and the attacking quarter line, the ball must cross the goal-line, or be on a path which would have resulted in it crossing the goal-line, at a height of not more than 460 mm before any deflection, for a goal to be scored.
