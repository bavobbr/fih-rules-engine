This could involve:\n    *   **No penalty:** If the umpire doesn't believe the play was dangerous.\n    *   **Free Hit:** Awarded to the opposing team if the play was deemed dangerous.\n    *   **Penalty:** If the play was deemed dangerous and a more severe penalty is warranted, such as a caution (Rule 14.1 a) or a suspension (green or yellow card).\n4.  **Communicate the Decision:** The umpire would communicate the decision clearly using the appropriate signals and verbal explanations, if necessary.\n\n**Key Considerations for Dangerous Play:**\n\n*   **Intent:** Was the action intentional?\n*   **Height of the Ball:** Was the ball raised dangerously (Rule 9.9)?\n*   **Proximity:** Was the play within 5 meters of an opponent (Rule 9.9)?\n*   **Risk of Injury:** Did the play pose a risk of injury to another player?\n\n**Important Note:** The umpire's judgment is crucial in these situations.

(Rule 9.8) A personal penalty may also be awarded to offending players. (Rule 9.8)\n*   **Stick Height:** Playing the ball with any part of the stick above shoulder height is generally dangerous, except for defenders stopping or deflecting a shot at goal. (Rule 9.7)\n*   **Penalty Corner:** Dangerous play resulting from a legitimate stop or deflection by a defender results in a penalty corner. (Rule 9.7)\n*   **Penalty Stroke:** If a defender attempts to stop or deflect a ball travelling towards the goal which will actually miss the goal, any use of the stick above the shoulder must be penalised by a penalty corner and not a penalty stroke. (Rule 9.7)\n*   **Penalty Corner (Defending):** If a defender is within three metres of the first shot at goal during the taking of a penalty corner and is struck by the ball below the knee, another penalty corner must be awarded or is struck on or above the knee in a normal stance, the shot is judged to be dangerous and a free push must be awarded to the defending team.
